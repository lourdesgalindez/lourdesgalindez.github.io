My birth name is Maria Lourdes Galindez, but I like to go by Lourdes Galindez only. I was born in Maryland, U.S., but lived my whole life in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From a very young age I have been interested in non fiction writing and creative work. At the age of four I was writing fairy tales and illustrating small graphics. Throughout the years I have written both in English and Spanish equally. Iâ€™m currently studying journalism at The New School in Manhattan and will graduate in May of 2020. I am design oriented, and all my pieces are usually accompanied by visuals.
